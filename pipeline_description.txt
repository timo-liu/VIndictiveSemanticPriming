compute embeddings with consolidateheatmaps.py # ./heatmaps.ps1
compute rsa from the heatmaps (dissimilarity matrices) # rsa.py
then do rsa analysis # rsa_rho_analysis.py
further analysis with layer ranking # dissect.py
Do silhouette scores over embeddings difference k-means # k_shadow.py
k_shadow doesn't really work, trying checking if the vector differences are learnable # k_learning.py


3d print for fun # dissect3d.py
